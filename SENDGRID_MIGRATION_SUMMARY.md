# SendGrid Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated from MailerSend to SendGrid for email sending and inbound email capture. This provides a more reliable and scalable email infrastructure.

## ✅ Completed Changes

### 1. SendGrid Email Sending Service
- **Created**: `/lib/sendgrid.ts` - Centralized SendGrid email service
- **Features**:
  - SendGrid API integration (API key configured in environment variables)
  - Support for HTML/text emails, attachments, reply-to configuration
  - Error handling and logging
  - Verified sender domain handling

### 2. Campaign Email Automation Update
- **Updated**: `/app/api/campaigns/automation/send-emails/route.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Replaced Gmail API/SMTP with SendGrid API
  - Simplified authentication (no per-sender OAuth needed)
  - Updated inbox logging to track SendGrid usage
  - Maintained timezone-aware sending and sender rotation

### 3. SendGrid Webhook for Inbound Emails
- **Enhanced**: `/app/api/webhooks/sendgrid/route.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Processes SendGrid Inbound Parse webhooks
  - Extracts email data from multipart form submissions
  - Maps emails to campaigns via sender email lookup
  - Stores replies in `inbox_messages` and `inbox_threads` tables
  - Thread conversation ID generation for proper email threading

### 4. Database Schema
- **Verified**: Existing `inbox_messages` and `inbox_threads` tables support SendGrid
- **Schema**: Uses `provider: 'smtp'` for SendGrid emails (matching allowed values)
- **Conversation Threading**: Maintains proper email thread relationships

## 📧 Configuration Required

### SendGrid Inbound Parse Setup
Your SendGrid account needs to be configured with:

**Inbound Parse Settings:**
- **Host**: `reply.leadsup.io`
- **URL**: `http://app.leadsup.io/api/webhooks/sendgrid`
- **POST Method**: Enabled
- **Raw Email**: Optional (not required)

### DNS Configuration
Set up MX records for `reply.leadsup.io`:
```
reply.leadsup.io. MX 10 mx.sendgrid.net.
```

### Sender Domain Verification
For production use, verify your sending domains in SendGrid:
1. Go to SendGrid Dashboard → Settings → Sender Authentication
2. Verify your domain (leadsup.io)
3. Set up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records

## 🔄 How It Works

### Outbound Email Flow
1. Campaign automation triggers email send
2. System selects assigned sender for prospect
3. Email sent via SendGrid API using your API key
4. SendGrid delivers email from verified domain
5. Email logged to `inbox_messages` table as 'outbound'

### Inbound Email Flow
1. Recipient replies to campaign email
2. Reply goes to `reply.leadsup.io` (your parse domain)
3. SendGrid processes reply and POSTs to webhook
4. Webhook extracts email data and finds matching campaign
5. Reply stored in `inbox_messages` as 'inbound'
6. Thread updated in `inbox_threads` with latest message info

### Email Threading
- Uses deterministic conversation IDs based on participants + campaign
- Groups all emails between same sender/recipient in same conversation
- Maintains thread continuity across outbound campaigns and inbound replies

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Script
- **Created**: `test-sendgrid-integration.js`
- **Tests**:
  - SendGrid API key configuration
  - Email sending functionality
  - Webhook endpoint accessibility
  - Configuration validation

### Test Results
- ✅ SendGrid API configured successfully
- ⚠️ Email send requires verified sender domain
- ✅ Webhook endpoint active and responsive
- ✅ Database schema compatible

## 🚀 Benefits of SendGrid Migration

### Reliability
- Professional email service provider
- High deliverability rates
- Built-in spam filtering and reputation management

### Scalability  
- No per-sender authentication setup needed
- Unified API for all email sending
- Better rate limiting and queue management

### Features
- Advanced analytics and tracking
- Inbound email parsing built-in
- Template engine support
- A/B testing capabilities

### Simplified Architecture
- One email provider instead of multiple (Gmail OAuth, SMTP, MailerSend)
- Centralized configuration and monitoring
- Easier debugging and maintenance

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Verify Sender Domain**: Set up domain authentication in SendGrid
2. **Configure DNS**: Set up MX records for reply.leadsup.io
3. **Test End-to-End**: Send campaign email and verify reply capture
4. **Monitor**: Check SendGrid dashboard for delivery metrics
5. **Cleanup**: Remove unused MailerSend configuration after testing

## 🔧 Environment Variables
Make sure these are set in production:
```env
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key_here
```
