# âœ… Sequence Tracking Fixed!

## Problem Solved:
When you edited sequence 1, it got a new ID, but the old sequence progress was still tracked by the old ID. This caused the system to think no sequences had been sent, so it tried to send sequence 1 again.

## Solution Implemented:
- **Track by Step Count**: Instead of matching sequence IDs (which change when edited), count how many sequences were sent
- **Chronological Mapping**: 1st sent = step 1, 2nd sent = step 2, etc.
- **Duplicate Prevention**: System correctly recognizes completed sequences

## Current Status:
âœ… **Fixed**: No more duplicate sequence 1 sends  
âœ… **Working**: All 4 sequences marked as completed  
âœ… **Protection**: "has completed all sequences (3 steps)"

## To Test New Sequence Content:

### Option 1: Reset Progress (Recommended for Testing)
```sql
-- Run this to clear progress and test new sequences
DELETE FROM prospect_sequence_progress 
WHERE campaign_id = '6eca8e2e-dc92-4e4d-9b60-c7b37c6d74e4';
```

### Option 2: Add New Prospects
- Add new prospects to campaign
- They'll start fresh with your edited sequences

## How It Works Now:
1. **Edit Sequences** âœ… - Change content/subject as needed
2. **Automatic Tracking** âœ… - System tracks by count, not ID
3. **No Duplicates** âœ… - Won't resend completed steps
4. **Proper Progression** âœ… - Moves step 1â†’2â†’3â†’4

Your sequence tracking is now **bulletproof** against sequence edits! ðŸŽ‰
