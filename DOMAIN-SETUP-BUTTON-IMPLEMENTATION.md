# Domain Setup Button Implementation

## 🎯 Overview

Added a **Domain Setup button** next to completed campaigns that provides users with two options:
1. **Automated Setup** via Domain Connect (one-click for major registrars)
2. **Manual DNS Setup** with user-friendly record guide

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

### Campaign Table Integration
- **Actions column** added to all campaign layout types (Email, LinkedIn, Multi-Channel)
- **Domain Setup button** appears only for campaigns with `status: 'Completed'`
- **Click isolation** - button clicks don't trigger campaign row selection
- **Responsive design** - button scales appropriately with table layout

### Domain Setup Flow
```
User clicks "Setup Domain" 
       ↓
Choose domain (e.g., yourdomain.com)
       ↓
Two options presented:
├─ Automated Setup (30 seconds) - Recommended
│  └─ Domain Connect popup for major registrars
└─ Manual Setup (5-10 minutes)
   └─ DNS records with copy-to-clipboard
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

Value: v=spf1 include:sendgrid.net ~all
Purpose: Email authentication (SPF)

Type: CNAME
Name: s1._domainkey
Value: s1.domainkey.u30435661.wl250.sendgrid.net
Purpose: Email signing (DKIM)

Type: MX
Name: reply
Value: mx.sendgrid.net
Priority: 10
Purpose: Route replies to LeadsUp

Type: TXT
Name: _leadsup-verify
Value: leadsup-verify-[timestamp]

```
