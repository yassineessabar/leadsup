# Campaign Creation Fields Enhancement

## Summary
Enhanced the campaign creation modal to include Location dropdown and Industry field on the first page, automatically fill keywords from website scraping, and pre-fill these fields in the Contact Scrapping section after campaign creation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Campaign Creation Modal (First Page)
**File:** `components/add-campaign-popup.tsx`

#### Added Fields:
- **Location Dropdown**: Pre-populated with 15 countries including:
  - Australia, United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Germany
  - France, Spain, Italy, Netherlands, Singapore
  - India, Japan, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa
  
- **Industry Field**: Free text input for specifying the company's industry
  - Placeholder: "e.g., Technology, Healthcare, Marketing"

#### Layout:
- Fields are arranged in a responsive 2-column grid on desktop
- Location dropdown on the left, Industry field on the right
- Both fields use consistent styling with the rest of the form

### 2. Automatic Keyword Population
**File:** `components/add-campaign-popup.tsx`

- Keywords extracted from website content are automatically added to the Keywords field on the second page
- Merges AI-extracted keywords with any manually entered keywords
- Removes duplicates automatically
- Updates happen after successful AI generation

### 3. Contact Scrapping Pre-filling
**File:** `components/campaign-dashboard.tsx`

When a campaign is created:
- **Industry** field is pre-filled with the industry from campaign creation
- **Location** field is pre-filled with the selected location
- **Keywords** field is pre-filled with all keywords (joined by commas)

### 4. Backend Support
**File:** `app/api/campaigns/create/route.ts`

- Industry field is now required in the CampaignFormData interface
- Industry is included in the AI generation context
- Industry is saved to the database (if the column exists)

## User Flow

1. **Campaign Creation**:
   - User fills in Company Name, Website
   - User selects Location from dropdown (e.g., "ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º Australia")
   - User enters Industry (e.g., "Digital Marketing")
   - User proceeds to next step

2. **AI Generation**:
   - System extracts keywords from website if provided
   - AI generates content considering location and industry context
   - Keywords are automatically populated on the ICPs & Personas page

3. **Contact Scrapping**:
   - After campaign creation, navigate to Contacts tab
   - Contact Scrapping section shows:
     - Industry: "Digital Marketing" (pre-filled)
     - Keywords: "marketing, automation, analytics, ..." (pre-filled)
     - Location: "Australia" (pre-filled)

## Benefits

1. **Improved Data Collection**: Captures more structured information about the company
2. **Better AI Context**: Industry and location help generate more relevant AI content
3. **Streamlined Workflow**: Automatic pre-filling reduces manual data entry
4. **Consistent Data**: Information flows seamlessly from creation to contact scrapping

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. Create a new campaign
2. Fill in all fields including Location and Industry
3. Complete the campaign creation wizard
4. Check that keywords are populated after AI generation
5. Navigate to Contacts tab
6. Verify Contact Scrapping fields are pre-filled correctly

## Technical Notes

- All changes are backward compatible
- Fields gracefully handle missing data with empty string defaults
- Keywords are properly deduplicated when merging manual and extracted terms
- Location dropdown includes country flag emojis for better UX
