# Campaign Tab Navigation Cleanup

## Summary
Removed all references to `?tab=campaigns` and standardized navigation to use only `tab=campaigns-email` throughout the application to prevent background rendering issues and unexpected tab displays.

## Changes Made

### 1. Main Page Component (`app/page.tsx`)
**Removed:** The `case "campaigns":` from the renderContent() switch statement
- Before: Both "campaigns" and "campaigns-email" cases rendered CampaignsList
- After: Only "campaigns-email" renders CampaignsList
- Impact: Prevents duplicate rendering and unexpected tab switching

### 2. Dashboard Sidebar (`components/dashboard-sidebar.tsx`)
**Updated:** Campaign creation buttons to navigate to campaigns-email
- Changed `onTabChange("campaigns")` → `onTabChange("campaigns-email")` (2 occurrences)
- Locations:
  - "Create Campaign" button in collapsed sidebar
  - "Create Campaign" button in expanded sidebar
- Kept highlighting logic: Campaign menu highlights when campaigns-email is active

### 3. Campaign Tab Component (`components/campaign-tab.tsx`)
**Updated:** Default tab checks to use campaigns-email
- Changed `activeSubTab === "campaigns"` → `activeSubTab === "campaigns-email"` (2 occurrences)
- Ensures proper display of campaign list when no specific sub-tab is selected

## Technical Details

### URL Structure
- **Before:** Could have `?tab=campaigns` or `?tab=campaigns-email`
- **After:** Only `?tab=campaigns-email` is used
- Sub-tabs remain: `campaigns-linkedin`, `campaigns-multi-channel`

### Navigation Flow
1. Clicking "Campaigns" in sidebar → navigates to `?tab=campaigns-email`
2. Create Campaign buttons → navigate to `?tab=campaigns-email`
3. Campaign menu item highlights when on any campaigns sub-tab
4. Default campaign view shows email campaigns

## Benefits

1. **Consistency:** Single source of truth for campaign tab navigation
2. **No Background Rendering:** Eliminates duplicate tab rendering issues
3. **Cleaner URLs:** Standardized URL parameters
4. **Predictable Behavior:** Always shows email campaigns by default
5. **Simpler Logic:** Reduced complexity in tab switching logic

## Testing Checklist

✅ Click "Campaigns" in sidebar → shows campaigns-email tab
✅ Create Campaign button → navigates to campaigns-email
✅ Campaign menu highlights correctly when active
✅ No `?tab=campaigns` appears in URL
✅ Campaign list displays properly
✅ Sub-tabs (LinkedIn, Multi-Channel) still work
✅ Build completes without errors

## Migration Notes

No database changes required. This is purely a frontend navigation fix. Users with bookmarked URLs containing `?tab=campaigns` will need to update to `?tab=campaigns-email`, or the system will default to the dashboard view.
