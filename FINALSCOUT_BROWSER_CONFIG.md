# FinalScout Browser Configuration

## üéØ Updated Behavior

### "Find Profiles" Button (LinkedIn Scraping):
- ‚úÖ **Runs in headless mode** (background, no browser window)
- ‚úÖ **Fully automated** - no manual intervention needed
- ‚úÖ **Fast execution** for bulk profile discovery

### "Enrich Emails" Button (FinalScout):  
- ‚úÖ **Opens visible browser window** for FinalScout interaction
- ‚úÖ **Allows manual intervention** if needed for CAPTCHAs/verification
- ‚úÖ **Shows real progress** as contacts are enriched

## üîß Required Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# LinkedIn Credentials (for profile finding)
LINKEDIN_EMAIL=your-linkedin-email@example.com
LINKEDIN_PASSWORD=your-linkedin-password

# FinalScout Credentials (for email enrichment)  
SCOUT_EMAIL=your-finalscout-email@example.com
SCOUT_PASSWORD=your-finalscout-password
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Browser Behavior

### Profile Finding (Headless):
```
HEADLESS_BROWSER=true
- No browser window opens
- Runs completely in background
- Faster execution
- No manual interaction needed
```

### Email Enrichment (Visible):
```
HEADLESS_BROWSER=false  
- Browser window opens and is visible
- You can see FinalScout working
- Manual intervention possible for challenges
- Real-time visual progress
```

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

### 1. Find Profiles Process:
1. Click "Find Profiles" button
2. LinkedIn scraper runs in headless mode
3. Profiles saved to database automatically
4. No browser window appears
5. Real-time progress in UI

### 2. Email Enrichment Process:
1. Click "Enrich Emails" button  
2. **Browser window opens** showing FinalScout
3. You can watch the enrichment process
4. Manual intervention possible if needed
5. Contacts saved as emails are found
6. Real-time progress in UI

## üîç Benefits of Visible Browser for Email Enrichment

### Why show browser for FinalScout:
- **Manual CAPTCHA solving** if required
- **Visual confirmation** of enrichment progress
- **Debugging capabilities** if issues occur
- **Manual intervention** for challenging profiles
- **Real-time monitoring** of the process

### Why headless for LinkedIn:
- **Faster execution** for bulk profile discovery  
- **Background processing** doesn't interfere with work
- **Automated login** handles most authentication
- **Better for server deployment** in production

## üöÄ Usage Instructions

### First Time Setup:
1. Add both LinkedIn and FinalScout credentials to `.env.local`
2. Restart your development server
3. Test "Find Profiles" (headless - no window)
4. Test "Enrich Emails" (visible - browser opens)

### Production Deployment:
- LinkedIn scraping works well in headless mode on servers
- Email enrichment might need adjustment for server environments
- Consider running email enrichment on local machine if server restrictions apply

## üéõÔ∏è Manual Override

If you need to override browser visibility, you can set:
```bash
# Force both scripts to use same mode (not recommended)
HEADLESS_BROWSER=true   # All scripts headless
HEADLESS_BROWSER=false  # All scripts visible
```

But the default behavior is optimized:
- **LinkedIn**: Headless (automated)
- **FinalScout**: Visible (interactive)

## ‚úÖ Ready to Use!

Your integration now provides the best of both worlds:
- üöÄ **Fast automated profile discovery** (headless LinkedIn)
- üëÅÔ∏è **Interactive email enrichment** (visible FinalScout)
- üìä **Real-time progress tracking** for both processes
