# Email Sequence Automation Implementation

## Summary
Implemented automatic population of AI-generated email sequences into the campaign's Sequence tab after creation. The system now creates 2 sequences with 3 emails each, properly timed according to best practices for email outreach campaigns.

## Sequence Structure

### Sequence 1: Initial Outreach
- **Email 1**: Day 0 - Introduction/Awareness
- **Email 2**: Day 3 - First Follow-up/Value Demonstration  
- **Email 3**: Day 6 - Final Follow-up/Call to Action

### Sequence 2: Re-engagement Campaign (60 days later)
- **Email 4**: Day 66 - Re-engagement after break
- **Email 5**: Day 69 - Renewed Value Proposition
- **Email 6**: Day 72 - Last Call to Action

## Implementation Details

### 1. AI Generation Enhancement
**File:** `app/api/campaigns/create/route.ts`

The AI now generates 6 emails instead of 3:
- Updated OpenAI prompt to request 6 emails for 2-sequence campaign
- First 3 emails for initial outreach
- Last 3 emails for re-engagement after 60 days
- Increased max_tokens from 1000 to 1500 for complete generation

### 2. Campaign Dashboard Integration
**File:** `components/campaign-dashboard.tsx`

When a campaign is created with AI assets:
```javascript
// Automatically populate sequences with AI-generated emails
if (campaignData.aiAssets && campaignData.aiAssets.email_sequences) {
  // Create Sequence 1: Days 0, 3, 6
  // Create Sequence 2: Days 66, 69, 72
  setSteps(newSteps)
}
```

### 3. Auto-Save Functionality
- Sequences are automatically saved 5 seconds after any change
- Preserves all email content, timing, and structure
- Integrated with existing campaign save system

## Features

### AI-Powered Content
- Personalized email content based on:
  - Company information
  - Industry and location
  - ICP and persona data
  - Pain points and value propositions
  - Selected language

### Smart Variables
All emails include merge variables:
- `{{firstName}}` - Recipient's first name
- `{{companyName}}` - Recipient's company
- `{{senderName}}` - Sender's name
- Custom variables as needed

### Timing Logic
- **Sequence 1**: Aggressive follow-up (3-day intervals)
- **60-day break**: Allows prospects time to consider
- **Sequence 2**: Re-engagement with new angle (3-day intervals)

## User Flow

1. **Campaign Creation**
   - User fills in company details
   - AI generates ICPs, personas, and email sequences
   - User reviews and proceeds

2. **Automatic Population**
   - Upon campaign creation, sequences are auto-populated
   - 6 emails distributed across 2 sequences
   - Proper timing intervals set automatically

3. **Customization**
   - User can edit any email content
   - Adjust timing between emails
   - Add/remove emails as needed
   - Changes auto-save after 5 seconds

## Fallback Behavior

When OpenAI is unavailable:
- System uses 6 pre-written fallback emails
- Maintains same 2-sequence structure
- Follows identical timing pattern
- Ensures consistent user experience

## Benefits

1. **Time Savings**: No manual email creation needed
2. **Best Practices**: Follows proven email sequence patterns
3. **Personalization**: AI tailors content to specific business
4. **Consistency**: Standardized structure across campaigns
5. **Flexibility**: Full editing capabilities after generation

## Technical Notes

### Timing Calculations
```javascript
// Sequence 1
Email 1: Day 0
Email 2: Day 3 (0 + 3)
Email 3: Day 6 (3 + 3)

// Sequence 2 (after 60-day gap)
Email 4: Day 66 (6 + 60)
Email 5: Day 69 (66 + 3)
Email 6: Day 72 (69 + 3)
```

### Content Formatting
- Newlines (`\n`) converted to HTML breaks (`<br/>`)
- Variables properly escaped and preserved
- HTML content supported in email editor

## Testing Checklist

✅ Create new campaign with AI generation
✅ Verify 6 emails are generated
✅ Check Sequence tab shows 2 sequences
✅ Confirm timing: 0, 3, 6, 66, 69, 72 days
✅ Test email content editing
✅ Verify auto-save functionality
✅ Check variable preservation
✅ Test with different languages
✅ Validate fallback emails work

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for consideration:
- A/B testing variants for each email
- Dynamic timing based on engagement
- Industry-specific email templates
- Performance tracking integration
- Automated follow-up sequences based on opens/clicks
