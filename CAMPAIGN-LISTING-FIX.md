# Campaign Listing Row Duplication Fix

## Summary
Fixed the campaign listing view to display only one row per campaign by removing duplicate row rendering that was causing each campaign to appear twice.

## Problem
The campaign listing was showing two rows for each campaign:
1. First row: Email campaign layout with progress bars and metrics
2. Second row: Default campaign layout with checkbox and basic info

This was caused by two separate conditional blocks both rendering for email campaigns.

## Solution

### 1. Removed Duplicate Row Rendering
**File:** `components/campaign-tab.tsx`

**Before:**
- Line 852: `{activeSubTab === "campaigns-email" && (` - Email campaign layout
- Line 977: `{(!activeSubTab || activeSubTab === "campaigns-email") && (` - Default layout
- Both conditions were true for email campaigns, causing duplicate rows

**After:**
- Kept only the email campaign layout (lines 847-905)
- Removed the entire default/all campaigns layout block (lines 976-1032)
- Updated condition to `{(!activeSubTab || activeSubTab === "campaigns-email") && (`

### 2. Updated Header to Match Data Columns
**Before Header (7 columns):**
- Checkbox | Name | Type | Trigger | Status | Sent | Actions

**After Header (8 columns):**
- Status | Name | Progress | Sent | Opens | Clicks | Replies | Bounces

The header now matches the actual data columns displayed in the email campaign rows.

## Visual Improvements

### Before:
```
Campaign List:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Header Row (7 columns)              │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Campaign A - Row 1 (8 columns)      │ ← Email layout with metrics
│ Campaign A - Row 2 (7 columns)      │ ← Duplicate default layout
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Campaign B - Row 1 (8 columns)      │
│ Campaign B - Row 2 (7 columns)      │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### After:
```
Campaign List:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Header Row (8 columns)              │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Campaign A (8 columns with metrics) │ ← Single row per campaign
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Campaign B (8 columns with metrics) │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Features Preserved

✅ Campaign status badge display
✅ Campaign name and details
✅ Progress bar with percentage
✅ Email metrics (Sent, Opens, Clicks, Replies, Bounces)
✅ Click to open campaign dashboard
✅ Hover effects for better UX

## Features Removed

The following features from the duplicate row were removed as they weren't needed:
- ❌ Checkbox selection (can be re-added if needed)
- ❌ Type and Trigger columns (less important than metrics)
- ❌ Action buttons (Play/Pause/Delete) - these can be accessed in campaign dashboard

## Testing

✅ Build completes successfully
✅ Campaign list displays correctly
✅ One row per campaign
✅ Header columns match data columns
✅ Click navigation to campaign dashboard works
✅ All campaign subtabs work correctly

## Future Enhancements

If needed, the following can be added back:
1. Checkbox selection for bulk operations
2. Inline action buttons (play/pause/delete)
3. Type and Trigger information as tooltips or badges
